# Unveiling inflammatory and prehypertrophic cell populations as key contributors to knee cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis using multi-omics data integration

**Objectives:**  
Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis of human knee articular cartilage tissue to present a comprehensive transcriptome landscape and osteoarthritis (OA)-critical cell populations.

**Methods:**  
Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatially resolved transcriptomic technology have been applied to characterise the cellular heterogeneity of human knee articular cartilage collected from 8 OA donors and 3 non-OA control donors, totaling 19 samples. The novel chondrocyte populations and marker genes of interest were validated by immunohistochemistry staining, quantitative real-time PCR, etc. The OA-critical cell populations were validated through integrative analyses of publicly available bulk RNA sequencing data and large-scale genome-wide association studies.

**Results:**  
We identified 33 cell population-specific marker genes that define 11 chondrocyte populations, including 9 known populations and 2 new populations: pre-inflammatory chondrocyte population (preInfC) and inflammatory chondrocyte population (InfC). The novel findings include:  
1. The novel InfC activates the mediator MIF-CD74.  
2. The prehypertrophic chondrocyte (preHTC) and hypertrophic chondrocyte (HTC) are potentially OA-critical cell populations.  
3. Most OA-associated differentially expressed genes reside in the articular surface and superficial zone.  
4. The prefibrocartilage chondrocyte (preFC) population is a major contributor to the stratification of patients with OA, resulting in both an inflammatory-related subtype and a non-inflammatory-related subtype.

**Conclusions:**  
Our results highlight InfC, preHTC, preFC, and HTC as potential cell populations to target for therapy. We conclude that profiling these cell populations in patients could be used to stratify patient populations, defining cohorts for clinical trials and precision medicine.
